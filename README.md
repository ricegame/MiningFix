<h1>Mining Fix</h1>
<p style="font-size: larger">
<em>Fixes</em> some issues with mining in hypixel skyblock

<h2>IMPORTANT: the mod is cooked rn bcs I havn't updated for mining changes I think, idk it just doesnt work well at all</h2>

while I dont think it is, this is probably bannable, if you get banned for using this that's a major skill issue tbh

<b>READ: THE MOD WILL NOT WORK UNTIL THE SERVER STARTS "TICKING"!!! You can see when it starts with the tps hud, whenever that is >0 it means the server is "ticking".</b>

  <summary>How do i know its not a rat?</summary>

Read the code.

Or, here's how u can decompile and check for rats:
- Install Intellij IDEA CE
- File -> New -> Project
- Press CTRL + ALT + SHIFT + S to open Project Structure
- Go to Libraries and press the +
- Choose Java and locate the mod you are trying to decompile
- After you have done that, go to "External Libraries" in your Project
- Browse the classes and try to find something like "Minecraft.getMinecraft().getSession();", which may be obfuscated.
- There are probably better ways of decompiling but idk them I don't do it.
- Good luck.
