  <summary>How do i know its not a rat?</summary>

Read the code.

Or, here's how u can decompile and check for rats:
- Install Intellij IDEA CE
- File -> New -> Project
- Press CTRL + ALT + SHIFT + S to open Project Structure
- Go to Libraries and press the +
- Choose Java and locate the mod you are trying to decompile
- After you have done that, go to "External Libraries" in your Project
- Browse the classes and try to find something like "Minecraft.getMinecraft().getSession();", which may be obfuscated.
- There are probably better ways of decompiling but idk them I don't do it.
- Good luck.
